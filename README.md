Turn Album Covers Into Music If You Want To Do That For Some Reason.

## Environment
We've used [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for these experiments. Create a new environment from the [`environment.yml`](environment.yml):
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate aural-travels
```

## Data
We perform experiments on the FMA dataset, which was created by MichaÃ«l Defferrard, Kirell Benzi, Pierre Vandergheynst and Xavier Bresson ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01840), [GitHub](https://github.com/mdeff/fma)). The dataset contains 106,574 untrimmed tracks in 161 unbalanced genres from the [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/).


### Preparation
The following files of the [FMA dataset](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) need to be downloaded and extracted ahead of time:
- [`fma_full.zip`](https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_full.zip) (879 GiB)
- [`fma_metadata.zip`](https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_metadata.zip) (342 MiB)

Extract them into a directory, such that you have a `fma_full` directory and a `fma_metadata` directory next to each other. This data directory needs to be specified at several points in this repository.

Once the data has been downloaded and extracted, we need to enrich it with album-level information. The reason is that the FMA metadata is stored on track-level, while in this work we are more interested in album-level classification and prediction. Also, we need to download album covers, which are [not included](https://github.com/mdeff/fma/issues/51) in the FMA dataset.

Let `$DATA_DIR` be your FMA data directory, then run the following command to add album-level information:
```
PYTHONPATH=. tools/prepare_album_data.py \
    --data_dir $DATA_DIR \
    --output_file $DATA_DIR/fma_metadata_albums.csv \
    --album_cover_dir $DATA_DIR/fma_album_covers
```

### Discussion
The FMA dataset has a couple of advantages:
1. The music is licensed under Creative Commons.
2. It is standardized, making it easier for others to reproduce these experiments.
3. It covers a wide set of genres (electronic, rock, hip-hop, classical, etc.).

A potential disadvantage of the FMA dataset is that its music might be quite different from commercial data, since it is provided at least to some degree by hobbyists. Furthermore, there is a risk that album covers are not as descriptive as for commercial data: at least for some of the data we looked at, the album covers seemed to be more of an afterthought. However, we hope that we can use this dataset for pre-training, and then try fine-tuning models on commercial data.
