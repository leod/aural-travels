## Data

We perform experiments on the FMA dataset, which was created by MichaÃ«l Defferrard, Kirell Benzi, Pierre Vandergheynst and Xavier Bresson ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01840), [GitHub](https://github.com/mdeff/fma)). 
This repository requires the full dataset, `fma_full.zip` (879 GiB), to be downloaded and extracted ahead of time. The dataset contains 106,574 untrimmed tracks from 161 unbalanced genres.

### Discussion
This dataset has a couple of advantages:
1. The music is licensed under Creative Commons.
2. It is standardized, making it easier for others to reproduce my experiments.
3. It covers a wide set of genres (electronic, rock, hip-hop, classical, etc.).

The disadvantage is that the music and album covers might be quite different from commercial data, since they are provided at least to some degree by hobbyists. There is a risk that album covers are not as descriptive as for commercial data. However, we hope that we can use this data for pre-training, and then experiment with fine-tuning the model on commercial data.
